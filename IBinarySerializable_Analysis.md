# IBinarySerializable Interface Analysis

## Question
Do we need the custom `IBinarySerializable` interface? Doesn't C# have a standard interface for this?

## Current Implementation

The project defines a custom `IBinarySerializable` interface in `/workspace/SoG_SGreader/Serialization/IBinarySerializable.cs`:

```csharp
public interface IBinarySerializable
{
    void Serialize(BinaryWriter writer);
    void Deserialize(BinaryReader reader);
}
```

This interface is implemented by **22 classes** in the codebase, including:
- Player
- Item
- Skill
- Enemy
- Quest
- Card
- And many more game objects

## C#'s Standard Serialization Interface

C# does provide a standard interface for serialization: `ISerializable` from `System.Runtime.Serialization` namespace.

### ISerializable Interface
```csharp
public interface ISerializable
{
    void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context);
}
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Custom IBinarySerializable | Standard ISerializable |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Direct binary read/write operations | Framework-managed serialization |
| **Control** | Full manual control over binary format | Framework handles serialization format |
| **Methods** | `Serialize(BinaryWriter)` & `Deserialize(BinaryReader)` | `GetObjectData(SerializationInfo, StreamingContext)` |
| **Deserialization** | Explicit `Deserialize()` method | Special constructor required |
| **Usage** | Direct BinaryReader/BinaryWriter | Works with BinaryFormatter, XML, etc. |
| **Performance** | Potentially faster (direct binary ops) | Framework overhead |
| **Flexibility** | Complete control over binary format | Framework-defined format |

## Analysis

### Why the Custom Interface is Justified

1. **Direct Binary Control**: The project appears to be reading/writing game save files with a specific binary format. The custom interface provides direct control over exactly how each byte is written and read.

2. **Performance**: Direct `BinaryWriter`/`BinaryReader` operations are faster than framework serialization, which is important for game data processing.

3. **Simplicity**: The interface is much simpler than `ISerializable`:
   - No need for special deserialization constructors
   - No need to work with `SerializationInfo` and `StreamingContext`
   - Symmetrical serialize/deserialize methods

4. **Custom Format**: Game save files often have proprietary binary formats that don't align with .NET's standard serialization format.

### Example Usage Pattern
```csharp
public class Flag : IBinarySerializable
{
    public SogFlag FlagID { get; set; }

    public void Serialize(BinaryWriter writer)
    {
        writer.Write((int)FlagID);
    }

    public void Deserialize(BinaryReader reader)
    {
        FlagID = (SogFlag)reader.ReadInt32();
    }
}
```

This is much cleaner and more direct than implementing `ISerializable` would be.

## Conclusion

**The custom `IBinarySerializable` interface is justified and should be kept** for the following reasons:

1. **Purpose-built**: It's specifically designed for binary serialization with direct control over the format
2. **Performance**: Direct binary operations are faster than framework serialization
3. **Simplicity**: Much easier to implement than `ISerializable`
4. **Game-specific**: Appears to be designed for reading/writing game save files with a specific binary format
5. **Widespread usage**: Already implemented across 22 classes in the codebase

The standard `ISerializable` interface is designed for general-purpose serialization with framework support, while this custom interface is optimized for direct binary operations on game data. They serve different purposes and the custom interface is more appropriate for this use case.

## Recommendation

**Keep the custom `IBinarySerializable` interface.** It's well-designed for its specific purpose and provides better performance and control for binary serialization of game data than the standard .NET serialization interfaces would provide.
